# Workbench refactor stage 2 implementation evidence

## Scope

This dated Processed note records the RF-300–308 implementation slice. It does not
replace ADR-010, the design-system catalog, or independent Verification evidence.
Legacy templates, product navigation, backend business behavior, authentication, and
provider state are unchanged.

## Implemented design-system slice

- `packages/design-system/src/tokens.css` defines dark, light, and high-contrast
  semantic foundations. Components consume semantic variables; reviewed multicolor
  resource icons are the explicit exception.
- Sixteen reusable React task icons cover the existing product categories plus common
  authoring needs. Selected, disabled, notification, accessible-label, and current-color
  behavior is owned by one component.
- One sidebar host composes flat, grouped/collapsible, tree, search, filter, detail,
  favorites/recent, and fixed-footer patterns. Selection, query/filter state, empty
  state, metadata rows, tree semantics, and native controls are implemented behavior.
- Panel layouts implement detail, list-detail, collection, settings form, dashboard,
  document, adjustable split, timeline, and kanban compositions. Layouts own real
  content slots and responsive collapse. The split separator supports pointer and
  keyboard adjustment with an announced value.
- Common controls include button, icon button, field, text/number/date/select,
  multiselect, checkbox, and toggle. Display and feedback assets include tabs, resource
  tree/table, metric, lazy visualization frame, code, Markdown, JSON, dialog, menu,
  popover, toast, and loading/empty/error/permission/busy/stale/success/progress states.
  Markdown renders plain text and only explicit HTTP(S) links; it never injects HTML.
- Dialog teardown removes keyboard handling, traps nested focus, restores the prior
  connected focus target, and supports Escape/backdrop/native button dismissal.

## Catalog and runtime

The versioned TypeScript catalog is the single descriptor and implementation registry.
Every descriptor names its allowed region, closed properties, binding arrays, actions,
states, accessibility behavior, provenance, and synthetic example. Registry construction
rejects missing IDs and unsupported properties. Package tests exercise descriptor
validity, ID uniqueness, complete implementation coverage, missing IDs, unsupported
properties, and runtime instantiation.

`apps/web` exposes the author/customer preview only at `/catalog`; normal product
navigation remains unchanged. The preview switches theme, 180/268/520-pixel sidebar
width, asset, and common state, and exposes real selection, search/filter, split, form,
dialog, toast, focus, and resize behavior using explicitly synthetic data. Its narrow
layout has a dedicated 390-pixel rule. Optional chart implementation remains outside
the base bundle behind a lightweight frame.

The Workbench sidebar schema adds `favorites-recent@1`; deterministic Python and
TypeScript generated contract artifacts were regenerated. Contract fixtures add the
favorites/recent sidebar and adjustable split descriptors. The runtime delegates asset
construction to the same registry used by the preview.

## Asset provenance and compatibility

`packages/design-system/catalog/provenance.json` records exact legacy source paths and
SHA-256 identities for six reviewed multicolor resource SVGs. Material Icon Theme
5.38.1 remains the file-tree source inventory, with its existing provenance and license
retained under `static/ui`; Tabler 3.46.0 is retained as a legacy comparison input. No
third-party generated JavaScript bundle was copied into the React implementation.

Stable IDs are immutable within a major version, overlapping aliases are prohibited,
and deprecation requires a named replacement and one release window before next-major
removal. Legacy removal still requires consumer migration, byte/provenance comparison,
visual/accessibility gates, and a rollback observation period.

## Verification boundary

Work performed the authorized dependency lock update and deterministic contract
generation only. It did not run tests, lint, type checks, builds, servers, browser
checks, screenshots, or other verification. RF-300–308 therefore remain `부분 완료`
until independent Verification runs the Stage 1 affected gates plus component tests,
real Chromium previews at requested themes and widths, keyboard/focus and remount
regressions, screenshots, and production build. The global legacy Ruff, packaging,
source-inventory, runtime-image, and PostgreSQL limitations recorded after Stage 1
remain unchanged.

## Failed-Verification revision

The revision following Verification run `run-20260912T112457925023Z-278b02af`
addresses findings RF2-V001 through RF2-V006 without expanding the Stage 2 product
scope:

- `resource-header@1` now has a real registered implementation, and the web package
  includes server-rendered regressions for both the retained Documents `/` route and
  the separate `/catalog` route.
- The task-list settings icon is now the unambiguous `preferences@1`; the panel retains
  `settings@1`. Descriptor IDs and implementation IDs remain one-to-one.
- DOM collections use `Array.from`, and the field child contract is compatible with
  React element construction, correcting the reported TypeScript errors.
- Descriptors now advertise only renderer-supported closed properties. Binding inputs,
  outputs, and actions are explicitly empty when no runtime callback exists; supported
  states reflect actual ready, empty, disabled, or feedback behavior. Per-asset examples
  use only accepted properties and are instantiated through the same registry in tests.
- The split layout changes to a real three-row mobile grid. At narrow width it exposes
  horizontal separator orientation, uses Up/Down keys and pointer Y coordinates, and
  updates the visible row percentage; desktop retains vertical orientation, Left/Right,
  and pointer X coordinates.
- Maintained tests now cover component interaction, search empty state, tab focus,
  mobile split semantics, dialog focus restoration/remount cleanup, unsafe Markdown,
  disabled inputs, normal/catalog route rendering, and a real Chromium matrix for all
  three themes, 180/268/520 widths, 390-pixel split resizing, screenshots, focus, and
  reload teardown.

Work still did not execute these verification gates. This section records correction
scope and intended coverage, not a pass claim.

## Second failed-Verification revision

The revision following Verification run `run-20260912T113803579504Z-41c6b362`
addresses RF2-R2-V001 through RF2-R2-V006:

- The React act-environment global uses an explicit type-safe intersection cast.
- Web Vitest configuration excludes `dist` and `dist-types`, keeping no-cleanup test
  discovery on authored sources after composite TypeScript output exists.
- The Chromium width assertion now follows the application-wide border-box contract.
- Mobile split rows use a definite 360-pixel frame and a numeric ratio over its
  328-pixel content track budget, so keyboard and pointer changes resolve to visible
  geometry rather than an indefinite percentage.
- Interactive descriptors now declare bounded inputs, outputs, and allowlisted actions.
  The implementation registry passes inputs to controls/compositions and dispatches
  typed `select`, `submit`, `toggle`, or `dismiss` events to the caller. It rejects
  unknown inputs, actions, outputs, types, and bounds. Catalog tests exercise every
  advertised action/output contract, while component tests exercise a real toggle
  transition.
- Dialogs use unique `useId` labels and an explicit open-dialog stack. Only the topmost
  layer owns Tab, Escape, and backdrop dismissal. Tests cover nested open/close order,
  unique labels, focus restoration through both layers, and destruction while open.

These are Work corrections only. The independent no-cleanup checks, build, browser
matrix, screenshots, and geometry assertions remain pending Verification.

## Final independent Verification

Verification run `run-20260912T121543075174Z-70a142f9` passed the final Stage 2 Work
run `run-20260912T121403471303Z-1ed3b0ef` with no remaining findings. It passed frozen
pnpm and uv installs, `git diff --check`, the full `make workbench-check` before and
after an intervening `make workbench-build`, 17 design-system tests, the other package
tests and 14 Python tests. The production Chromium catalog matrix exercised routing,
all theme and region-width combinations, the 390-pixel viewport, keyboard focus,
remount and overflow behavior, and produced ten screenshots in
`/tmp/agent-factory-catalog-r6`. The existing Python deprecation warnings and unrelated
legacy/full-refactor limitations remain unchanged.
