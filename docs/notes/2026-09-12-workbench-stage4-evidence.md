# Workbench refactor stage 4 implementation evidence

## Scope

This dated Processed note records the RF-500–507 implementation slice. It does not replace
the maintained Workbench runtime specification or ADR-003/005/007/010. Work authored source
and focused tests and refreshed the dependency lock as implementation work. Work did not run
tests, type checks, lint, builds, servers, browser automation, or migrations.

## Implemented vertical slice

- `packages/workbench-runtime` now owns shared standard/customer registration, closed-tree
  diagnostics, the React renderer, an injected binding port, exact operation input/output
  validation, replacement/context/unmount cancellation, stale-reply generations, bounded
  scoped caching, allowlisted action dispatch, and release-scoped view-state persistence.
- The design-system registry remains the single implementation source. Its navigational,
  slot, table, header, and content inputs now publish nested caller-owned contracts; normal
  public layouts no longer inject business sample rows. Named catalog and web preview
  fixtures remain explicitly synthetic.
- `packages/workbench-editor` provides searchable component and layout palettes,
  allowed-region insertion, keyboard and button reordering/removal, descriptor-backed
  property and binding controls, field-addressed diagnostics, bounded undo/redo,
  serialization/import validation, and an exact-draft runtime preview.
- The authenticated React composition exposes separate `/workbench` and `/authoring` paths.
  Their transport is a clearly named in-browser preview fixture. The production runtime
  package imports no API SDK and selects no network URL.
- The owning platform specification now states the runtime, binding, action, view-state,
  and authoring boundaries. RF-508 remains intentionally unimplemented until RF-600–604
  provide server-owned draft, authorization, revision, and immutable release behavior.

## Prior evidence and retained limits

Stage 3 was independently passed by Verification run
`run-20260912T131345046578Z-e5de8b0c`. That run passed `make workbench-check` (30
TypeScript and 15 Python tests), every web/Python build, a clean base-to-0025 migration,
and `make verify-theme-profiles` twice against the same disposable PostgreSQL 16 plus
pgvector database. Its PostgreSQL evidence included forced RLS, concurrent first writes,
revision-only audit, and audit-failure non-rollback; Chromium included keyboard behavior,
same-user second-context restoration, and context isolation.

Stage 4 was independently passed on 2026-09-12 by Verification run
`run-20260912T144640723466Z-e8821fb6` for Work run
`run-20260912T144425365083Z-03a501a3` and request SHA-256
`13db41e25829398e2f98c6676aaf425eca408eb0a05748d7608cc386737ca235`.
Verification passed `make workbench-check` (51 TypeScript and 15 Python tests), the unmodified
`make verify-workbench-runtime` before and after the production build (21 runtime and three editor
tests plus the Chromium full fixture flow), and `make workbench-build` for the web application and
six Python packages. Chromium covered actual refresh dispatch, exact asset-specific accessible
insertion, theme/keyboard/state restoration/remount behavior, and the 390px viewport. Verification
changed no Stage 4 project file.

Legacy vanilla theme migration, full standard-feature ports, server publication, deployed
rollout and observation, and remaining global baseline gates remain outstanding. The
preview fixture establishes no server authorization, persistence, tenant isolation, or
publication evidence.
