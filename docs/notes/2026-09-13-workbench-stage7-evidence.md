# Workbench refactor stage 7 evidence

## Scope

This dated Processed note records the authored identity and authorization dependency slice for
RF-605–607 and RF-800. Maintained authentication, authorization, organization, database, security,
and Workspace contracts remain authoritative. This Work evidence is not an independent pass record
and does not complete organization, Workspace, or administrator UI porting.

## Authored ownership move

- `platform-core/identity` now owns immutable identity records, the canonical `Principal`, explicit
  clock/crypto/repository/settings ports, the full password/session/external identity/email
  verification/password reset/API-token lifecycle, structured core errors, and authorization
  scope/context/policy. Password reset retains all-session revocation and one-time tokens remain an
  atomic repository operation.
- `platform-core/organizations/permissions.py` is the single permission, default-role, and legacy
  token-alias catalog. Role validation and token scope expansion use core errors. The former
  application module is a compatible import only.
- `platform-adapters/identity` implements Argon2 verification and upgrade, HMAC digests, secure
  randomness, system time, Google/GitHub provider verification, deployed-table PostgreSQL identity
  persistence, transaction-local tenant context, active organization membership gating, live
  Workspace checks, and direct/team permission-source DTO projection. It imports neither `app.*`
  nor delivery implementations.
- `apps/api/.../composition/identity.py` constructs the same core services for the target API and
  transitional authenticated application. Its thin session adapter owns the unchanged HTTP cookie
  attributes. Existing dependency function identities, routes, CSRF, OAuth callback, HTTP error
  handlers, MCP consumers, and callers remain in place through thin aliases or DTO translation.
- No migration was added or rewritten: the adapter uses the deployed schema directly. No renderer,
  public URL, cookie, stored hash, token prefix, role ID, or OAuth flow was intentionally changed.

## Authored verification coverage

- Pure core tests use deterministic clock/crypto and in-memory ports for generic credential failure,
  lockout, hash upgrade, session creation/resolution/logout, external login, email verification,
  one-time reset, all-session revocation, API-token create/list/revoke, scope subset denial, and
  legacy alias containment.
- The architecture guard now inspects static, dotted, `importlib.import_module`, and `__import__`
  imports. It rejects framework/database/provider/adapter/application imports from core and reverse
  application imports from the new identity adapters. The common Workbench test target now includes
  the owning core and adapter package unit suites.
- Existing root authentication characterization no longer asserts the removed ORM implementation
  mechanism; provider and HTTP/cookie behavior coverage remains.
- `tests/test_cloud_platform_integration.py` now exercises both production PostgreSQL identity
  repositories and target composition against the disposable PostgreSQL 16/pgvector database. Its
  Stage 7 matrix covers pre-existing credential/session rows, suspended and soft-deleted users,
  expired and revoked sessions, existing-user and new-user external identity provisioning,
  password-reset session revocation, concurrent one-time-token consumption, live membership/role/
  Workspace changes, two-tenant isolation, transaction-local forced-RLS context, real HTTP login,
  and authenticated MCP token use.
- `tests/browser/workbench-documents-db.cjs` now obtains its production session through the rendered
  login page, enters the enabled Workbench Documents experience over real HTTP/PostgreSQL, logs out
  with the production CSRF contract, confirms `/api/auth/me` rejects the revoked session, and
  confirms protected Workbench navigation returns to login. The integration fixture also checks
  the corresponding persisted session row is revoked.

## Exact independent commands

From the repository root, Verification can provision a labeled disposable
`pgvector/pgvector:pg16` container, migrate it, create a `NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS` application role,
run the production HTTP/MCP identity matrix and browser flow, and remove the container with:

```bash
CLOUD_VERIFY_PYTHON=.venv/bin/python bash scripts/verify-cloud-platform.sh
```

With an independently migrated disposable PostgreSQL already available, the focused identity and
browser-containing cases can instead be selected explicitly after setting the same admin and
non-owner URLs used by that script:

```bash
AGENT_FACTORY_DATABASE_URL="$CLOUD_TEST_DATABASE_URL" .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q \
  tests/test_cloud_platform_integration.py::test_identity_postgres_http_mcp_lifecycle_and_current_authority \
  tests/test_cloud_platform_integration.py::test_authenticated_workbench_authoring_with_real_postgres_and_http
```

## Verification handoff and limitations

Work did not execute tests, linters, type checks, builds, browsers, servers, migrations, or
PostgreSQL, as required by the Work boundary. Independent Verification must execute the authored
fresh forced-RLS PostgreSQL matrix and all remaining acceptance gates from the delegated request,
including package/offline installation, focused security checks, and relevant legacy regressions.
Real OAuth provider credentials/network login, container image execution, deployment, rollout
observation, and legacy removal remain unproved.

## Final independent decision

Independent Verification run `run-20260912T210629133865Z-53fef65b` passed the final Stage 7 Work
run `run-20260912T210518583300Z-a7174acc`, bound to original-request SHA-256
`280f3444bf846a686f1c56bcf613d1bd14d7927ddfc7926580f979b7afb05002`, with no remaining
findings. The final evidence included `make workbench-check` (61 TypeScript and 33 Python tests plus
format, lint, types, contracts, and dependency gates), the four personal-Workspace cases, the fresh
PostgreSQL identity HTTP/MCP lifecycle matrix, and two independent fresh-database production
browser passes. Each database used PostgreSQL 16.15 with pgvector 0.6 and a
`NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS` application role migrated through `0026`. The browser passes covered
rendered login, persisted Workbench/Documents authoring and conflict handling, both rollback
directions, logout, stored session revocation, HTTP 401, and login redirect.

This decision closes only the Stage 7 identity/authorization slice. It does not establish full
RF-605–607 or RF-800 completion, complete remaining domains or administrator/standard UI, prove
full Documents parity, workers, the MCP App case gate, deployment, observation, or removal.
