# Workbench refactor stage 1 implementation evidence

## Scope and authority

This dated note records the RF-100–105 and RF-200–204 implementation slice. It is
Processed implementation evidence, not a replacement for the maintained ADRs or
platform specifications. The legacy `app/`, `template/`, and `static/` feature paths
remain unchanged.

## Implemented contracts

- `contracts/schemas/workbench/v1/` owns closed definition, release, descriptor,
  sidebar, panel, component, binding, action, and view-state schemas.
- `contracts/schemas/catalog/v1/asset-descriptor.schema.json` uses a fixed parameter
  vocabulary rather than accepting embedded JSON Schema. Catalog parameters are
  bounded scalar/list declarations; external references and arbitrary schema keywords
  are not representable.
- `contracts/schemas/appearance/v1/theme-profile.schema.json` permits only the
  `dark`, `light`, and `high-contrast` foundations, compact/comfortable density, and
  approved semantic color tokens. It has no CSS, SVG, import, URL, header, or
  credential field.
- Workbench v1 is deliberately a fixed, versioned vocabulary. New action kinds,
  binding sources, layout families, or executable capabilities require a schema and
  renderer version change; unknown properties remain rejected. Future extensibility
  is not modeled as free-form extension objects.

The bounded runtime policy is 262,144 encoded bytes, depth 12, 5,000 JSON nodes,
4,096 characters per string, and 100 milliseconds measured validation time. Component
counts are additionally limited to 40 in the 사이드바 and 80 in the 패널. Schema
generation rejects traversal, network, and cross-directory references; only local
fragments and sibling schema filenames are accepted.

## Generated packages and gates

`scripts/generate_workbench_contracts.py` deterministically emits useful TypedDict and
TypeScript interfaces plus canonical schema/fixture bundles. `--check` compares the
expected bytes with every generated file without depending on Git tracking. Python
and TypeScript validators apply the same limit source and schema bundle. The parity
gate runs both validators over the same valid and invalid manifest.

The compatibility gate examines required properties, removed closed-object
properties, narrowed types/enums, and tightened numeric/string/collection bounds. Its
fixtures prove both an additive compatible change and multiple real breaking changes;
it does not infer compatibility from a version label.

The dependency guard parses Python imports and TypeScript static, export, `require`,
and dynamic imports. It checks forbidden core SDK/framework imports and relative
cross-package bypasses. Root tests include explicit violations and allowed core →
contracts and adapters → core examples.

## Verification-finding revision

The revision after failed Verification reconciles camel-case state/input identifiers
with the bounded path vocabulary used by the Documents fixture. Component properties
now use an explicit fixed allowlist instead of a negative property-name list, and text
values reject URL schemes, protocol-relative URLs, executable expressions, and raw
markup. Dedicated fixtures cover WebSocket, FTP, access-token, and request-header
bypasses.

Compatibility analysis now covers constants, patterns, object closure, constrained
additional properties, uniqueness, formats, type/enum restrictions, bounds, local
references, combinators, items, and pattern properties used by the Stage 1 vocabulary.
Generated types now include every asset parameter field and precise component/catalog
state, asset kind, parameter type, sidebar/panel asset, accessibility, provenance, and
theme-override structures. Python and TypeScript type fixtures exercise all parameter
variants and nested structures.

The dependency guard now parses `pyproject.toml` project, optional, and build-system
requirements plus `package.json` runtime, optional, peer, and development dependencies.
Manifest fixtures cover forbidden and allowed Python and TypeScript dependency edges.

The subsequent TypeScript revision uses AJV's declared named `Ajv2020` constructor,
which avoids default-import interop ambiguity under NodeNext. The parity entrypoint
uses the command-owned repository-root working directory rather than non-portable
`import.meta.dirname`, allowing the pinned `tsx` runner to select either module
transform without changing fixture resolution.

## Minimal composition

- `packages/platform-core` contains a framework-independent Workbench query and port.
- `packages/platform-adapters` provides the stage-1 reference-fixture port adapter.
- `apps/api` composes FastAPI liveness, readiness, and reference fixture routes.
  Readiness returns 503 when `DATABASE_URL` is absent and explicitly reports that no
  database check ran; configuration alone is not represented as a live DB check.
- `apps/worker` exposes only an explicit offline `--smoke` fixture validation mode.
- `apps/web` is a minimal Vite/React health surface using the shared generated fixture,
  runtime, semantic tokens, and canonical 작업 목록 | 사이드바 | 패널 regions.
- The design-system catalog includes eight task icons, seven sidebar/navigation
  entries, nine panel layouts, controls, displays, feedback assets, full state/action
  metadata, accessibility metadata, provenance, examples, and unique versioned IDs.

## Locks and independent verification

The revision Work generated real root `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `uv.lock` files from the
declared workspace manifests. Work did not run verification. Independent Verification
run `run-20260912T110652332335Z-131f19c5`, bound to Work run
`run-20260912T110519020161Z-d6ce4e31`, subsequently passed the Stage 1 slice at commit
`301a4ea`.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile                         # passed with pnpm 10.15.1 / Node 22
uv sync --frozen --all-packages --extra dev           # passed with uv 0.8.15
make workbench-check                                  # passed
uv run agent-factory-worker --smoke                   # passed
make workbench-build                                  # passed
make workbench-check                                  # passed again without cleanup
```

The common Workbench gate covered formatting, Ruff, ESLint, TypeScript and mypy,
deterministic generation, validator parity, compatibility and dependency checks, six
TypeScript tests, and 14 Python tests. The build transformed 211 Vite modules and built
all six Python sdists and wheels. The second no-cleanup gate demonstrates that generated
`dist-types` output no longer breaks dependency inspection.

This evidence does not make the global legacy baseline green. Root `make check` still
encounters pre-existing Ruff formatting drift after dependency resolution, and the
legacy full pytest surface retains packaging/setuptools, source-inventory,
runtime-image, and PostgreSQL prerequisite limitations. Those limitations remain
outside the Stage 1 focused pass and are not reclassified here.
