# MCP credential and status consumer authority checkpoint

This Processed evidence records the static source inventory and authored changes for
Work run `run-20260913T165204388195Z-c2791fae`. It is a pre-Verification checkpoint,
not proof of runtime acceptance, integrated-stage completion, or permission to delete
legacy implementations.

## Credential authority

| Public operation | Previous live authority | Authored target authority | Preserved boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `integration_token_set` | `app.mcp.integrations.invoke` → `cloud_services` → legacy `CloudConnections` | `build_target_credential_service` → `provider_credential_use_cases` → target PostgreSQL credential repository | authenticated organization/Workspace, `integration:manage`, `integration.update`, approved scopes, encrypted persistence and redacted MCP result |
| `integration_oauth_begin` | same legacy factory and service | same target credential composition | server configuration identity, approved scopes, encrypted ten-minute state bound to user/Workspace, and public result schema |
| `integration_oauth_complete` | same legacy factory and service | same target credential composition; the scoped connection supplies the provider when the MCP schema has no provider field | one-time consume, expiry/replay rejection, connection/provider/configuration binding, encrypted credentials, and bounded errors |

New target OAuth states store explicit provider and configuration identities. The
completion use case also accepts the prior encrypted `redirect_uri` state shape when
provider is absent, derives provider only from the state-bound scoped connection, and
still compares the current configuration. This is bounded already-issued-state
compatibility; it is not a fallback to the legacy credential service.

`integration_inspect`, `integration_drive_browse`, and collection list/create/start/
execute/status/results/cancel already call `invoke_target` and
`build_target_collection_service`; this checkpoint leaves that authority unchanged.
The target collection bridge still consumes established integration ORM tables and
models as persistence compatibility. Separate legacy HTTP routes in
`app/router/integrations.py`, the packaged guide, model registration, rollback tests,
and direct legacy service tests remain concrete consumers of `app/modules/integration`.
They are retained and are not deletion candidates in this checkpoint.

## MCP status consumers

The maintained backend authority is the target `GET .../mcp-connections` route, which
returns `{state, connections}`. Its current consumers are:

- `ConnectionsWorkbench`, which reads the aggregate object and renders
  `connections`;
- `WorkspaceWorkbench`, whose management client and refresh/check paths now require
  the aggregate object rather than accepting a second bare-array contract;
- `tests/browser/native-management.cjs`, which now observes pending after issue,
  verified only after a successful real scoped MCP call, and reauth-required after
  revocation through `connections`, while retaining configuration delivery and purge;
- legacy `static/js/mcp-connection.js` and its browser rollback gate, retained until
  the later zero-live-consumer and rollback decision point.

## Authored acceptance coverage and limitations

Focused tests now exercise the actual MCP tool adapters for all three credential
operations, exact authorization inputs, stable projections, provider derivation, and
secret-redacted domain/unknown failures reaching the session transaction boundary.
Target core coverage includes wrong-user/Workspace binding, state expiry/replay,
configuration change, encryption persistence, and transitional state decoding. The
fresh PostgreSQL acceptance was extended to call target-composed token and OAuth MCP
operations, inspect ciphertext rather than plaintext, and cover wrong Workspace,
replay, expiry, callback compatibility, and absence of secrets from results/logs.

Work did not run tests, type checks, builds, migrations, browsers, or runtime probes.
Independent Verification must establish the actual results, including fresh forced-RLS
composition and the native configuration/revocation/purge scenario. RF-801–804 and
RF-1000–1005 remain partial or pending; the integrated stage and definitive deletion
remain incomplete.
